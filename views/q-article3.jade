					| We’re celebrating the birthday of the late, great Neil Armstrong. He was the first person to walk on the moon 44 years ago, and knowledge that we have about space has grown immensely since then. Here are 5 incredible images from space from this decade so far:

					p.copy NASA's Hubble Space Telescope captured the bipolar star-forming region, called Sharpless 2-106, which looks like a snow angel. Sharpless 2-106, Sh2-106 or S106 for short, lies nearly 2,000 light-years from us. The nebula measures several light-years in length. It appears in a relatively isolated region of the Milky Way galaxy. These images were taken in February 2011. Image credit: NASA/ESA Hubble

					p.copy The European Space Operations Centre captured this, among other startling images depicting space junk in orbit around Earth, which they shared at the European Conference on Space Debris (who knew that was a thing!) on April 25, 2013. This includes pieces from ISS contraction, accidental discards like gloves and cameras, and pieces of exploded spacecrafts. Via universetoday.com

					p.copy A long and complex strand of plasma hanging above the Sun's surface erupted on Jan. 31, 2013. It is  as a long loop that stretched and broke apart as it burst into space. It is called it a 'dragon tail filament' because before it erupted, it did resemble one. This image is from NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and was taken in a wavelength of extreme ultraviolet light (304 Angstroms). Image credit: NASA/SDO
